# üêõ Product Cards Run Off the Page
Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:
* As a user, I want to view all products in two or more rows.
* As a user, I don't want to scroll horizontally to see additional products.

## Expected Behavior
Product cards that don't fit within the first row should display in the next row.

## Actual Behavior
Product cards run off the page in a single row.

## Assets
The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance:

## üí° Hints
* What additional flexbox properties could help direct the behavior of child elements?

## üèÜ Bonus
If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:
1. By default, flexbox runs in rows, left to right. In what other directions could it run?
* The default is row and can be omitted for horizontal layouts. You can also specify the fill characteristics via the align-item and align-content attributes, which define the positioning via fill or spacing respectively, and the flex-wrap attribute that controls wrapping behavior or elements.

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
